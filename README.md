In this Fish Classification project I combined what I could learn from varies differente 

The things I'm going to say into words in this fish classification project I come back what I learned from various different sources and using those sources I have made a neural network using ANN

First I import the necessary library then I shaped off the frame of the image data then I got the data and split the data. As train test and validation then I augmented the data creating a model. With the model I first made an input layer than the hidden layers and finally the output layer after creating the model I trained it. Also use a callback for any kind of errors because I occurred with some errors while using Kaggle
